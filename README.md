# Search-Engine-Data-Collector

## Introduction
This repository contains code that launches a website allowing users to annotate Google Search results to find **source pages**
A **source page** is defined to be a website that holds specific information about an object. In the case of an iPad, it could be the page that holds the technical specifications. In the case of a politician, it could be their official website. The goal is to find the page that holds information specific to that object to prepare for data extraction.

### About
The webite uses the Django framework along with Bootstrap for frontend.

2. ~~Add option to switch graph views~~

1. Fix sidebar

1. Add more data analytical options?

3. Collect lots of data
